                <p>We may use the information we collect or receive about you for various purposes.</p>
                <p>a<em>.&nbsp;<u>To Provide You With the Services</u></em></p>
                <p>We use your information to provide you the Services. For example, we use credit card information to
                    complete a transaction or an address to allow the Bellboy to fulfill your delivery. If the
                    applicable information is to be provided or Service is to be performed by a third party, then we
                    will disclose the applicable Personal Information to the third party providing the information or
                    performing applicable Services. Your information may be available or provided to third-party service
                    providers and that are contractually obligated to protect your information as disclosed in this
                    Policy.</p>
                <p>b<em>.&nbsp;<u>To Maintain, Improve, and Personalize the Services</u></em></p>
                <p>We use your information for our everyday business operations such as auditing, administration of the
                    Services, forum management, fulfillment, and analytics. Your information may also be used to improve
                    the content and/or functionality of the Services. We may use your information to help us improve
                    offerings for Bellboy and/or our Merchants. We also use your information to personalize your
                    experience. For example, we may personalize the content and features you see when visiting our
                    Services. In addition, we may personalize advertisements, marketing communications, and
                    recommendations to make them more tailored to your interests.</p>
                <p>c<em>.&nbsp;<u>To Communicate with You</u></em></p>
                <p>We use your information to communicate with you. For example, we may send you text messages or other
                    notifications about the status of your orders, deliveries and ride hires. We may also contact you
                    with promotional offerings or other communications that may be of interest to you. If we send you
                    marketing emails about services that may interest you, each email will contain instructions
                    permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future email marketing communications.</p>
                <p>In the event you contact us, we use certain information to respond to your questions and assist you
                    with any issues that may arise in your use of the Services. If you send text messages to a Bellboy,
                    using the telephone number for that Bellboy available on the Services, we may use a third-party
                    service provider to track and analyze these text messages. We track these text messages for fraud
                    prevention, to ensure appropriate charging of fees, to enforce our Terms and Conditions, and for
                    quality and training purposes. As part of this process, Bellboy and its service provider will
                    receive in real time and store data about your text message, including the date and time of the text
                    message, your phone number, and the content of the text message. You will not be able to opt out of
                    transactional text messages between you and Bellboy.</p>
                <p>d<em>.&nbsp;<u>For Account and Network Security Purposes</u></em></p>
                <p>We care about keeping you secure and safe while using our Services. Keeping you safe requires us to
                    process your Personal Information, such as your device information, activity information and other
                    relevant information. We use such information to combat spam, malware, malicious activity or
                    security risks; improve and enforce our security measures; and to monitor and verify your identity
                    so that unauthorized users do not gain access to your information.</p>
                <p>e<em>.&nbsp;<u>To Maintain Legal and Regulatory Compliance</u></em></p>
                <p>Our Services are subject to certain laws and regulations which may require us to process your
                    Personal Information. For example, we process your Personal Information to pay our taxes, to fulfill
                    our business obligations, ensure compliance with employment and recruitment laws or as necessary to
