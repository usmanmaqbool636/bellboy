                <p><br></p>

                    and are listed on the Website and Mobile Application by our Third Party Providers that are selling
                    the product or service. Items in your Shopping Cart will always reflect the most recent price
                    displayed on the item's product detail page. Please note that this price may differ from the price
                    shown for the item when you first placed it in your cart. Placing an item in your cart does not
                    reserve the price shown at that time. It is also possible that an item's price may decrease between
                    the time you place it in your basket and the time you purchase it.</p>

                    provide refunds and it is solely at their discretion if they choose to do so.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are determined to provide the most accurate pricing information on
                    the Website and/or Mobile Application to our users; however, errors may still occur, such as cases
                    when the price of an item is not displayed correctly on the Site. As such, we reserve the right to
                    refuse or cancel any order. In the event that an item is mispriced, we may, at our own discretion,
                    either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. We
                    shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed
                    and your prepayment processed. If such a cancellation occurs on your prepaid order, our policies for
                    refund will apply. </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We list availability information for products listed on the Website and
                    Mobile Application, including on each product information page. Beyond what we say on that page or
                    otherwise on the Application, we cannot be more specific about availability or product details as
                    that is the responsibility of our third party vendors. Please note that dispatch estimates are just
                    that. They are not guaranteed dispatch times and should not be relied upon as such. As we process
                    your order, you will be informed by e-mail or SMS if any products you order turn out to be
                    unavailable.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that there are cases when an order cannot be processed
                    for various reasons. The Company reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason at
                    any given time. You may be asked to provide additional verifications or information, including but
                    not limited to phone number and address, before we accept the order.</p>

                <p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each user is entitled to only open one account and have use of
                    a Bellboy Wallet which is linked to either their credit and/or debit card to facilitate payment for
                    any products and services offered on the Website and Mobile Application. That the User stipulates
                    that their account will be linked to a working credit and/or debit card that is active and not
                    expired. </p>

                    Wallet through either JazzCash or Easy Paisa. </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid any fraud with credit or debit cards, we reserve
                    the right to obtain validation of your payment details before providing you with the product and to
                    verify the personal information you shared with us. This verification can take the shape of an
                    identity, place of residence, or banking information check. The absence of an answer following such
                    an inquiry will automatically cause the cancellation of the order within a reasonable timeline. We
                    reserve the right to proceed to direct cancellation of an order for which we suspect a risk of
                    fraudulent use of banking instruments or other reasons without prior notice or any subsequent legal
                    liability.</p>

                <p><strong>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH THE
                        COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. THIS SECTION 12 OF THIS AGREEMENT
                        SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”.</strong></p>
                <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<strong>Scope of Arbitration Agreement.</strong>&nbsp;You
                    agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services as a
                    consumer of our Services, to any advertising or marketing communications regarding the Company or
                    the Services, to any products or services sold or distributed through the Services that you received
                    as a consumer of our Services, or to any aspect of your relationship or transactions with Company as
                    a consumer of our Services including but not limited to use of your personal data information will
                    be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in
                    small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances
                    only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or the Company may seek
                    equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as
                    trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration
                    Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the
                    Effective Date of this Agreement.</p>
                <p><strong>CASES HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY—AND OTHERS MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE—THAT ATTEMPT
                        TO ASSERT CLASS ACTION CLAIMS, AND BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT YOU ELECT NOT TO
                        PARTICIPATE IN SUCH CASES.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH THE COMPANY, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT
                        PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY SUCH CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR
                        REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT. INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST
                        THE COMPANY IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE
                        AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.</strong></p>
                <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Rules and Forum.</strong>&nbsp;This
                    Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Arbitration Act 1940 in all respects. To begin an
                    arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to
                    the Company at _________________________. The arbitration will be conducted by an independent
                    arbitrator mutually agreed on by both parties under its rules and pursuant to the terms of this
                    Agreement. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under PKR ____________, not inclusive of
                    attorneys’ fees and interest. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video
                    conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another
                    mutually agreed location.</p>
                <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<strong>Arbitrator Powers.</strong>&nbsp;The arbitrator
                    shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,
                    enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim
                    that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide
                    the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company. The arbitration proceeding will not be
                    consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator
                    will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The
                    arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or
                    relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this
                    Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written statement of
                    decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to
                    render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall
                    follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual
                    basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on
                    you and the Company.</p>
                <p>(d)&nbsp;<strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong>&nbsp;YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
                    STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and the Company are instead
                    electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration, except as specified in section 12(a)
                    above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
                    limited.</p>
                <p>(e)&nbsp;<strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong>&nbsp;YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE TO
                    WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A CLASS,
                    COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION
                    AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN
                    ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
                    OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid
                    or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor the Company is
                    entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead, all such claims and disputes will then be
                    resolved in a court as set forth in Section 13.</p>
                <p>(f)&nbsp;<strong>Opt Out.</strong>&nbsp;You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so,
                    neither you nor the Company can force the other to arbitrate as a result of this Agreement. To opt
                    out, you must notify the Company in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to
                    this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Bellboy username
                    (if any), the email address you used to set up your Bellboy account (if you have one), and a CLEAR
                    statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice
                    to:&nbsp;_________________. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this
                    Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on
                    any other arbitration agreements that you may have entered into with us or may enter into in the
                    future with us. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTARY HEREIN, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
                    SUPERSEDE, AMEND, OR MODIFY THE TERMS OF ANY SEPARATE AGREEMENT(S) BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY
                    RELATING TO YOUR WORK AS AN EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
                    INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT GOVERNING YOUR SERVICES AS A BELLBOY. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT,
                    IF YOU ARE A BELLBOY, OPTING-OUT OF THE ARBITIRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 12 HAS NO
                    AFFECT ON YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES COVERED BY YOUR INDEPEDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT WITH
                    THE COMPANY.</p>
                <p>(g)&nbsp;<strong>Survival.</strong>&nbsp;This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of
                    your relationship with the Company.</p>
                <p>(h)&nbsp;<strong>Modification.</strong>&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the
                    contrary, we agree that if the Company makes any future material change to this Arbitration
                    Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to
                    the Company.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <h2>15. Exclusive Venue</h2>
                <p>To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both
                    you and the Company agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement
                    will be litigated exclusively in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.</p>
                <h2>16. Termination</h2>

                    Software or Service, or may modify, suspend or terminate your access to the Website, Mobile
                    Application, Software or the Services, for any reason, with or without notice to you and without
                    liability to you or any third party. In addition to suspending or terminating your access to the
                    Website, Mobile Application, Software or the Service, the Company reserves the right to take
                    appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal or injunctive
                    redress. Even after your right to use the Website, Mobile Application, Software or the Services is
                    terminated, this Agreement will remain enforceable against you. All provisions which by their nature
                    should survive to give effect to those provisions shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
